Description: This package loads and grooms geochemical proxy data, 
    writes a forward proxy system Bayesian heirarchical model, 
    and runs a MCMC inversion to generate posterior distributions of 
    user-specified proxy system parameters, and climate and carbon 
    cycle variables. This version includes the foraminiferal proxy 
    system, with plans to include phytoplankton, paleosol and 
    terrestrial plant proxy systems. Marine equilibrium constant (Ks)
    are calculated following Zeebe & Tyrrell (2019) and marine carbonate 
    chemistry calculations follow Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow (2001).
