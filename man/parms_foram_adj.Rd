\title{Revises prior distributions}
\usage{
parms_foram_adj(parms2change = parms2change, change_values = change_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{parms2change}{Provide a vector of character strings specifying which parameters to revise. The revisable parameters are 
defined in 'Details'.}

\item{change_values}{Provide a vector of values which correspond to 'priors2change' vector of parameter names.}
}
\value{
Returns list 'parms_foram_adj' which contains all of the values, revised or otherwise, for revisable parameters.
}
\description{
This function allows users to pull in the default system file which defines all user-accessible parameters, including priors,
and revise it as they see fit. This is a highly recommended step as prior distributions should reflect prior knowledge
for the specific study interval.
}
\details{
The following is a list of the revisable parameters which define the prior distributions:
--- S, T, P ---
'tempC.m' and 'tempC.sd' are the mean and stdev for temperature in degrees C 
'sal.m' and 'sal.sd' are the mean and stdev for salinity 
'press.m' and 'press.sd' are the mean and stdev for presure in bar
--- seawater composition ---
'd11Bsw.m' and 'd11Bsw.sd' are the mean and stdev for seawater d11B in per mille, SRM-951 
'd18Osw.m' and 'd18Osw.sd' are the mean and stdev for seawater d18O in per mille, VSMOW
'xca.m' and 'xca.sd' are the mean and stdev for Ca concentration of seawater in mmol/kg 
'xmg.m' and 'xmg.sd' are the mean and stdev for Mg concentration of seawater in mmol/kg 
'xso4.m' and 'xso4.sd' are the mean and stdev for SO4 concentration of seawater in mmol/kg 
'xca.lt' provides an option to prescribe linear change in Ca concentration of seawater as function of age, mmol/kg per kyr
'xmg.lt' provides an option to prescribe linear change in Mg concentration of seawater as function of age, mmol/kg per kyr
'xso4.lt' provides an option to prescribe linear change in SO4 concentration of seawater as function of age, mmol/kg per kyr
--- diagenesis d18O correction ---
'seccal' and 'seccal.sd' are the mean and stdev for the percentage of secondary calcite
'd18Oseccal' is the estiamted d18O, per mille VPDB, of secondary calcite
--- Mg/Ca temp calibration parameters ---
'Hp.mean' and 'Hp.sd' are the mean and stdev for nonlinearity of the relationship b/w shell and Mg/Casw
'Bmod.mean' and 'Bmod.sd' are the mean and stdev for modern, pre-corrected, pre-exponential constant in Mg/Ca-SST calibration
'A.mean' and 'A.sd' are the mean and stdev for the exponential constant in Mg/Ca-SST calibration
'pHpccorr' and 'pHpccorrsd' are the mean and stdev for the pH correction on Mg/Caf in % per tenth pH unit
--- d11B vital effect ---
'm.custom', 'm.customsd', 'c.custom', and 'c.customsd' specify 'custom' vital effect slope and intercept 
'Grub.coff', 'Tsac.coff', 'Ouni.coff', and 'borate.coff' are the 'c' intercept offsets for each modern species 'c' value; leave '0' for modern 
--- carboante chemistry ---
'pH.u' and 'pH.l' are the upper and lower bounds on uniform distribution for time step 1 in total scale
'carbchem2.m' and 'carbchem2.sd' are the mean and stdev for 2nd carbonate chemistry variable for time step 1*. 
Carbonate chemistry variables in the following units:
pH = 'total scale' equivalent 
DIC = μmol/kg
ALK = μmol/kg
CO3 = μmol/kg
HCO3 = μmol/kg
*Note that variable type, 'cc2ndparm.vt', should be specified in arguments in 'foram_priors' function. These values will be used if 
prior type, i.e. 'cc2ndparm.pt', is set to 't1' in 'foram_priors' argument. These values will not be used if prior type,
i.e. 'cc2ndparm.pt', is set to 'ts' in 'foram_priors' argument.
